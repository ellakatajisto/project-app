# Welcome to the project view app!

Start this application by running npm start and go to localhost:3000.

Improvements that could yet be done:

- icons/buttons for the menu bar (present in the design), and to the toggle button, it was somehow buggy so i left it for now
- adding another screen size between the smallest and the biggest for a smoother transition
- adhering even more precisely to the design in general
- using not pixels for margins and paddings but more consistently gap and/or rem or em
